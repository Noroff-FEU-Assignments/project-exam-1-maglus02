In the Project Exam 1, we used everything we learned during the first year of studies and put it into a new web page.

## Description

The Project Exam 1 was a test of all the skills we learned during our first year of studies. We were tasked with making a blog, and implenting it with WordPress. All the content for the blog were to be hosted on the WordPress instance, and then fetched to to the HTML and CSS page with JavaScript through the WordPress REST API. It also included a contact form, where we used JavaScript for validating the user inputs.

This put to test our:
- Design abilites
- HTML and CSS abilites
- JavaScript abilities
- User testing abilites
- WordPress REST API abilites

The blog itself is a tech and gaming blog. Made with a modern and sleek design.
